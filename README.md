# Eclipse sim and design optimiser

This was developed for coursework; I made it to attempt to account for the influence of Jupiter's moons on eclipse duration. The code was initially intended to simulate many moons, but after looking at their orbits, only IO seemed to actually be able to have significant influence.

The code also generates the lowest weight configuration for a set of power consumptions when using specific power sources and storage.

The models relatively simple but give's a bunch of intresting results.
